            <p>For the vast majority of the time since our species arrival on the evolutionary scene, we acquired food by gathering 
            it from the wild.But from as early as 11,000 BCE, people began a gradual transition away from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle 
            toward cultivating crops and raising animals for food.The shift to agriculture is believed to have occurred independently 
            in several parts of the world, including northern China, Central America, and the Fertile Crescent.

            Why did people give up hunting and gathering for farming? There are many plausible reasons, all of which likely played some
             role at different times and across different parts of the world: 
             <ol>
                <li>Changes in climate may have made it too cold or too dry to rely on wild food sources.</li>
                <li>Greater population density may have demanded more food than could be harvested from the wild,
                     and farming provided more food per acre, even if it did require more time and energy.</li>
                <li>Overhunting may have helped push woolly mammoths and other megafauna to extinction.</li>
                <li>Changing technology, such as domesticated seeds, would have made agriculture a more viable lifestyle.</li>
             </ol>
